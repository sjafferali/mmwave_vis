# Changelog


## [2.2.1] - 2025-03-06

### Fixed
- **Flask compatibility crash:** Fixed `AttributeError: property 'session' of 'RequestContext' object has no setter` that prevented devices from loading for some users. Caused by unpinned Flask dependency resolving to 3.2.x during Docker build, which removed the `RequestContext.session` setter that flask-socketio relies on. Users who installed or rebuilt the addon after Flask 3.2 was published would hit this on every WebSocket connection.

### Changed
- Pinned Flask to `>=3.1,<3.2` in `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent builds across all users regardless of install timing.
- Added `manage_session=False` to the SocketIO constructor. The addon does not use Flask sessions, so this bypasses the session handling code path entirely as additional protection against future Flask version changes.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-03-04

### Fixed
- **Crash when `mmwave_detection_areas` is null ([#issue](https://github.com/nickduvall921/mmwave_vis/issues/15)):** Some switches report `mmwave_detection_areas: null` in their Z2M payload. The backend tried to call `.get("area1")` on `None`, crashing the entire message handler on every incoming message and preventing devices from appearing in the list.
- **Resilient message processing:** The monolithic MQTT message handler has been split into isolated stages (device discovery, target tracking, zone reports, config updates). A failure in one stage no longer kills processing for the others — previously a single crash would abort the entire handler, flooding logs and stalling the UI.
- **Defensive data access throughout backend:** `num_targets` and `num_zones` now use `safe_int()` with sanity bounds instead of raw payload values passed to `range()`. Target IDs, command actions, and device list lookups all guard against unexpected types. Stale device references after lock release are handled safely.
- **Frontend null guards:** `parseZ2MArea` now rejects non-object values. All three zone area handlers (`mmwave_detection_areas`, `mmwave_interference_areas`, `mmwave_stay_areas`) validate the payload is a dict before iterating, preventing crashes when Z2M sends `null` or unexpected types.

### Added
- **Target Reporting banner:** A compact info banner appears above the radar chart when a device has Target Info Reporting disabled, explaining why no position data is visible. Includes a one-click "Enable now" link that sends the setting to the switch and dismisses itself.

### Changed
- Bumped version to 2.2.0.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-02-17

### Fixed
- **Multi-user bug:** Each browser session now tracks its own selected device independently. Previously, two users opening the addon would fight over a single global device selection, causing cross-talk and missed data.
- **Thread safety:** Device list is now protected with locks to prevent crashes (`dictionary changed size during iteration`) when MQTT messages arrive while the cleanup thread runs.
- **Crash on non-dict MQTT payloads:** Fixed `TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable` caused by Z2M publishing bare integers to parameter confirmation topics (e.g. `/set/mmWaveHoldTime`).
- **Internal code cleanup:** Byte parsing function moved out of loop to prevent fragile closure behavior.
- Wrapped all Plotly chart calls in try/catch to prevent UI crashes if chart element is unavailable.
- **Zone editing: non-target zones no longer draggable.** Shapes are only interactive when you click "Draw / Edit" on a specific zone. Previously, all zones became draggable whenever the editor was open, making selection difficult.
- **Zone editing: zones locked outside edit mode.** Zones on the radar map can no longer be accidentally dragged when no zone is selected for editing.

### Added
- **Connection status indicators:** Live Server and MQTT status dots in the status bar show green/red/pulsing states so you always know if the backend is connected.
- **Reconnection banner:** A banner appears when WebSocket disconnects and auto-dismisses on reconnect. MQTT broker disconnections are also surfaced.
- **Command error feedback:** Toast notifications appear when a command fails (e.g. no device selected, MQTT down, invalid parameter). Previously the UI silently did nothing.
- **Parameter validation:** All settings sent to the switch are now validated against a whitelist before being published to MQTT. Invalid or unexpected values are rejected with an error message instead of being forwarded blindly.
- **Accurate FOV overlay:** The radar grid now reflects the actual field of view instead of generic concentric circles. A solid cone shows the rated ±60° (120°) FOV, with a dimmer dashed cone showing the ±75° (150°) extended range observed in Inovelli beta testing. Range arcs are drawn at 1m intervals up to 6m with labels.
- **Non-target zone context during editing:** When editing a zone, other zones remain visible (dimmed) as scatter traces for spatial reference, but cannot be dragged or selected.

### Changed
- Bumped version to 2.1.0.
- Target table rendering now builds HTML in a single assignment instead of incremental `innerHTML +=`.
- On WebSocket reconnect, the frontend automatically re-subscribes to the previously selected device.
- Default radar map X scale widened from ±450cm to ±600cm to accommodate the full extended FOV cone.

## [2.0.2]

### Added
- Initial public release with live 2D radar tracking, multi-zone editor, interference management, and real-time sensor data.
