# Using the mmWave Visualizer with ZHA

This guide covers how to set up the mmWave Visualizer addon when you are using **ZHA** (Zigbee Home Automation) instead of Zigbee2MQTT.

> **Note:** The ZHA integration is experimental and may have unknown issues. I fully expect some stuff not to work right now.

---

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant with ZHA configured
- At least one **Inovelli VZM32-SN** switch paired to ZHA
- The mmWave Visualizer addon installed
- Custom ZHA Quirk installed in HA

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the Custom Quirk

> **Note:** This quirk is experimental and may have bugs. If you find one, please open an issue on GitHub with the `ZHA` label.

Before proceeding, make sure you have already installed and tested the official Inovelli Quirk:
https://help.inovelli.com/en/articles/13019007-blue-series-mmwave-presence-dimmer-switch-zha-custom-quirk-install

This repo includes two files that replace the official quirk:

```
mmwave_vis/zha_quirk/__init__.py
mmwave_vis/zha_quirk/VZM32SN.py
```

Copy these into your `config/zha_custom_quirks/inovelli/` directory, then restart Home Assistant.

### 2. Configure the Addon

Install the addon using the links in the README, then open the **Configuration** tab on the addon page in HA.

- Set `zigbee_stack` to `zha` for ZHA, or `z2m` for Zigbee2MQTT
- All other settings can be left as-is if running within HA
- If you run into issues, enable the **Debug** toggle for more diagnostic output in the log

## Home Assistant Integration

### Per-Area Presence Sensors 

The VZM32-SN supports up to 4 independently configured detection zones. To expose per-area occupancy as binary sensors in HA, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: zha_event
        event_data:
          device_ieee: "YOUR_DEVICE_IEEE"
          command: "mmwave_anyone_in_area"
    binary_sensor:
      - name: "mmWave Area 1 Occupied"
        unique_id: mmwave_area1_occupied
        state: "{{ trigger.event.data.args.area1 == 1 }}"
        device_class: occupancy
      - name: "mmWave Area 2 Occupied"
        unique_id: mmwave_area2_occupied
        state: "{{ trigger.event.data.args.area2 == 1 }}"
        device_class: occupancy
      - name: "mmWave Area 3 Occupied"
        unique_id: mmwave_area3_occupied
        state: "{{ trigger.event.data.args.area3 == 1 }}"
        device_class: occupancy
      - name: "mmWave Area 4 Occupied"
        unique_id: mmwave_area4_occupied
        state: "{{ trigger.event.data.args.area4 == 1 }}"
        device_class: occupancy
```

Replace `YOUR_DEVICE_IEEE` with the IEEE address of your VZM32-SN, found on the device page in ZHA.

Sensors will show `unavailable` until the first presence event fires after HA restarts, which happens automatically on the next presence change.

---

## Notes

Device names come from your HA device registry. To rename a device, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Zigbee Home Automation**, find the device, and edit its name there.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No devices appear in the dropdown

- Confirm your VZM32-SN is paired and showing as available in ZHA
- Check the addon log for `ZHA: discovered ...` messages — if none appear, the addon may not be reaching HA

### "No token found" warning in the log

The addon cannot authenticate to Home Assistant. Try a full stop and start of the addon (not just a restart).

If that still doesn't work, you can set a token manually:

1. In HA, go to your **Profile** page → scroll to **Long-Lived Access Tokens** → create one
2. In the addon Configuration tab, paste it into the `ha_token` field
3. Restart the addon

### 502 error on startup

HA Core wasn't fully ready when the addon started. The addon will retry automatically every few seconds — wait about 30 seconds and check the log again. This usually resolves on its own after a reboot.

### Settings (sensitivity, hold time, etc.) not showing correct values after selecting a device

Click the **Sync** button. This triggers a fresh read of all settings from the device and populates the sidebar.

### Stay zone coordinates invert after being set

This is a known firmware bug on the VZM32-SN. Re-applying the zone will invert the coordinates back to the correct values.
